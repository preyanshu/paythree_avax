## **Overview**



**PayThree** is a next-generation platform built natively for the **Somnia ecosystem**, designed to redefine how organizations manage global payroll and ESOPs.

From a single, intuitive dashboard, organizations can **batch-process payouts** in one blockchain transaction, guarantee **on-chain transparency** with every payment verifiable on Somniaâ€™s explorer, automate **ESOP vesting**, send **instant email notifications** for payouts and stock option events, and enable **cross-border, bank-free settlements** in seconds all while leveraging Somniaâ€™s ultra-scalable, low-fee infrastructure.

## **The Problems in Web3 Payroll Today**

-   High gas fees from one-by-one transactions
    
-   Wrong wallet addresses causing lost funds
    
-   Slow, costly cross-border payments
    
-   No real-time employee communication
    
-   Lack of ESOP lifecycle management


## **PayThreeâ€™s Solution**

-   **Batch Payouts** â€“ Pay multiple employees in one blockchain transaction
    
-   **Verified Wallets** â€“ Prevent costly payout errors
    
-   **On-Chain Transparency** â€“ All payouts verifiable on Etherscan
    
-   **Automated ESOP Vesting** â€“ Complete stock option lifecycle on-chain
    
-   **Automated Email Notifications** â€“ Instant payout/ESOP alerts to inbox
    
-   **Cross-Border, Bank-Free** â€“ Instant blockchain settlement worldwide


## **Why PayThree Stands Out from Other Web3 Payment Solutions**

1.  **Full ESOP Support** 
    
    -   Weâ€™re not just payroll  we handle the entire **stock option lifecycle**, including granting, vesting, and claiming, all on-chain.
        
2.  **Seamless Gasless Experience** 
    
    -   Using **off-chain endpoints** + meta-transactions, for the minimal gas experience.
        
3.  **Smart Contract per Organization** 
    
    -   Every org gets its **own deployed smart contract**, isolating funds, improving security, and enabling organization-specific custom logic.
        
4.  **Two-Way Communication** 
    
    -   Automated emails ensure employees always know when payouts happen  unlike most tools that rely only on blockchain explorers.
        
5.  **Integrated Employee Portal** 
    
    -   Other tools focus only on admin dashboards PayThree gives employees their **own secure space** to track pay, ESOPs, and notifications.
